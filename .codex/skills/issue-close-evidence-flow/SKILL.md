# Issue Close Evidence Flow

## Overview

Use this skill only when the work is actually ready to close or when you need to identify what evidence is still missing.
Do not use it for generic progress reports.
Return a close-ready evidence artifact or a concrete missing-evidence block, not a best-effort summary.

## Inputs

- Issue type:
  - normal Issue
  - milestone management Issue
- Completion mode:
  - code
  - non-code
- PR URL or commit SHA, if code
- Follow-up Issue/PR links, if any
- Follow-up detection sources:
  - Issue body / comments
  - merged PR body / comments
  - Phase D output
  - `tasks/issue-*.md`

## Workflow

1. Decide whether the closure is `code` or `non-code`.
2. Collect closure evidence:
   - PR URL or commit SHA when `code`
   - non-code completion reason when `non-code`
3. Detect follow-ups only from explicit sources:
   - Issue body / comments
   - merged PR body / comments
   - Phase D output
   - `tasks/issue-*.md`
4. If follow-up is only inferable and not explicitly linked, stop with `BLOCKED`.
5. Load [docs/issue_close_evidence_template.md](C:/work/infinitas_arena/infinitas_arena/docs/issue_close_evidence_template.md).
6. Fill the closure-evidence section.
7. If the Issue is a milestone-management Issue, add the milestone audit table too.
8. If executing the close, prefer the structured connector/write path when available.
9. Empty stdout / empty CLI response / confirmation absent response is not success evidence. If the first write path fails or cannot confirm creation, switch method and require exact read-back.
10. Confirm the closure evidence comment exists by returned comment URL/id or exact-body read-back before closing the Issue.
11. Use [references/closure-checklist.md](references/closure-checklist.md) to verify status vocabulary, links, follow-up evidence completeness, and close ordering.

Do not:
- replace the caller's readiness judgment with invented closure assumptions
- infer follow-up ownership or completion from implication alone

## Output Contract

Always return:
1. `Close recommendation`
2. `Missing evidence`
3. `Comment body`
4. `Final status`

Rules:
- If required evidence is missing, recommend `BLOCKED` instead of fabricating closure text.
- Preserve repository status vocabulary.
- For non-code closure, explain why code evidence is `N/A`.
- If no explicit follow-up is found, write `なし`.
- Do not invent follow-up numbers from implication alone.
- Closure evidence comment must be ready before recommending the close action.
- Empty or silent write-back responses are not closure evidence.
- Do not close an Issue until the posted closure evidence comment is confirmed to exist.
